    <h3>
      Who is the killer? Some people have been killed! You have managed to
      narrow the suspects down to just a few. Luckily, you know every person who
      those suspects have seen on the day of the murders. Task. Given a
      dictionary with all the names of the suspects and everyone that they have
      seen on that day which may look like this: {'James': ['Jacob', 'Bill',
      'Lucas'], 'Johnny': ['David', 'Kyle', 'Lucas'], 'Peter': ['Lucy', 'Kyle']}
      and also a list of the names of the dead people: ['Lucas', 'Bill'] return
      the name of the one killer, in our case 'James' because he is the only
      person that saw both 'Lucas' and 'Bill'
