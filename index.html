    <h3>
      A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed.

      Each segment is 8 bits long, meaning the order of these segments needs to be reversed, for example:
      
      11111111  00000000  00001111  10101010
       (byte1)   (byte2)   (byte3)   (byte4)
      should become:
      
      10101010  00001111  00000000  11111111
       (byte4)   (byte3)   (byte2)   (byte1)
      The total number of bits will always be a multiple of 8.
      
      The data is given in an array as such:
      
      [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]
      Note: In the C and NASM languages you are given the third parameter which is the number of segment blocks.
